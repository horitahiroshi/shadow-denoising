## **Abstract**

Image processing is an interesting and very challenging subject that can be used in many different applications such as security cameras, robotization of industries, autonomous vehicles in many different environments indoor and outdoor. Independently of the application, in real life one of the main causes of environment noise is shadow, which can heavily distort both image intensity (luminance) and color (chrominance). With this in mind, this project's goal is to treat this problem specificaly in forests ground images aiming offroad mobile robotization. For that, the focus is to detect the shadows and remove them, so the objects can clearly be seen and segmented.

## **1. Main objective**

Given the eucalyptus plantation scenario, this work's goal is to treat the shadow noise problem that occur in some specific period of a sunny day, for example at noon when the sun light is strong enough to project shadow spots all over the road, which difficult the image segmentation for object detection.

For this work, it is important to notice that as its goal is to detect and remove the shadow spots not worrying with performance for video frame processing, so every processing here will be done in a single image at a time.

The input images of this program must be from eucalyptus plantation's streets (see example on Figure1 below). All images used in this project was acquired by the author.

## **2. The shadow**

"Shadows will occur when direct light from a light source is partially or totally occluded. Shadow can be divided into two types: self shadow and cast shadow.
The self shadow is the part of an object that is not illuminated by direct light; the cast shadow is the dark area projected by an object on the background" [1].

The cast shadow of an object is partioned into umbra and penunbra regions. The umbra region is the part of the shadowed surface in which the direct light source is completely obscured by the occluding object. The penumbra is the part of the surface where the light source is only partially occluded, and it occurs when the light source is not a point source or due to diffraction of light rays [2].

## **3. Methodes**

### **3.1. Detecting the shadows**

Shadow detection algorithm must find the image regions in which there are shadows (umbra and penumbra), based on luminance of each pixel.

#### **3.1.1. Color spaces analysis**

First of all, an analysis of the possible color spaces and their combination into a grayscale was done to choose the best option for shadowed regions detection on scenario.

On first try, the V (value) layer of HSV color space was used to find the shadowed regions on image (see the [1stTry notebook](./notebook/1stTry.ipynb)).

Then, after the last assignment, it was presented the luminance as a combination of RGB colors as shown, whach was used as attribute to find shadowed regions.

    *luminance = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B*

#### **3.1.2. Clustering image into lit, penumbra and umbra regions**

Determined the attribute to be used to separate the lit and shadowed (penumbra and umbra) regions, which is luminance, it was done. The result of this step was the following.

#### **3.1.3. Filtering clusters from noise**

The output of this first step must be a mask with lit, penumbra and umbra regions of the image.

#### **3.2.2. Clustering penumbra regions**



#### **3.2.3. Clustering umbra regions**



### **3.3. Removing the shadows**

<!-- Once the shadow regions are found, it is possible to restore them as if there is no shadow in the scenario. -->

#### **3.3.1. Clusters analysis**



#### **3.3.2. Enhancing histograms from shadow regions**

<!-- With this in mind, it is necessary to:
- analyse the color in non-shadowed regions;
- re-ranging the shadowed region's color intensities;
- filter to remove the edges between the unshadowed regions and the non-shadowed regions. -->
<!-- enhance them by reranging the pixel intensities according to non-shadow regions histogram. -->
