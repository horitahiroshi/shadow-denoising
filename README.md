## **Abstract**

Image processing is an interesting and very challenging subject that can be used in many different applications such as security cameras, robotization of industries, autonomous vehicles in many different environments indoor and outdoor. Independently of the application, in real life one of the main causes of environment noise is shadow, which can heavily distort both image intensity (luminance) and color (chrominance). With this in mind, this project's goal is to treat this problem specificaly in forests ground image aiming offroad mobile robotization. For that, the focus is on image restoration so the objects can clearly be seen and segmented.
