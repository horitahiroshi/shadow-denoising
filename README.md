## **Abstract**

Image processing is an interesting and very challenging subject that can be used in many different applications such as security cameras, robotization of industries, autonomous vehicles in many different environments indoor and outdoor. Independently of the application, in real life one of the main causes of environment noise is shadow, which can heavily distort both image intensity (luminance) and color (chrominance). With this in mind, this project's goal is to treat this problem specificaly in forests ground images aiming offroad mobile robotization. For that, the focus is on image restoration so the objects can clearly be seen and segmented.

## **Main objective**

Given the eucalyptus plantation scenario, this work's goal is to treat the shadow noise problem that occur in some specific period of a sunny day, for example at noon when the sun light is strong enough to project shadow spots under the trees, which difficult the image segmentation for object detection.

The input images of this program must be from eucalyptus plantation's streets (see example on Figure1 below). All images used in this project was acquired by the author.
